# Data Science - Pokemon Analysis
## Introduction
My goal for this project was to analyze and visualize different information within the Pokemon games. I have played Pokemon for many years, and at one point I was playing in local and state competitions. What I wanted to see was the type descrpencies in the Pokemon games today, and how some types have 'better' stats over its counters. I also wanted to use Machine Learning to have my model be able to predict legendary Pokemon off of stats.

## Selection of Data
The data I selected was from Kaggle which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maca11/all-pokemon-dataset).

This data set has every Pokemon up until Calyrex Shadow Rider, the last Pokemon to be added in the previous generation. This data set includes regular pokemon, mega evolutions, legendary, and mythical pokemon. I originally wanted to add in the newest Pokemon, however, the games came out after I had started to work on this, and there was a lack of data on the 100+ newly added Pokemon.

There are a lot of columns that are not needed, such as Ability, BMI, and Experience type. I selected only the columns that I needed, because there were far more that I didn't need.
